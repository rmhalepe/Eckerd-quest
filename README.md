EckerdQuest is a text-based RPG (Role-Playing Game) based around Eckerd College. The game contains a completed tutorial, player class, a functioning map, a help menu, and a battle system. 

The battle system includes three types of battles: Social Battles, Wild Battles and Academic Battles. The corresponding enemies for the battle types are Students, Animals and Quizzes. These battles work like a puzzle, where the player must figure out the correct sequence of moves to win. There are some random chance elements that determine whether or not the playerâ€™s moves are successful as well. The higher the player's stats are, the higher the chances are for success.
